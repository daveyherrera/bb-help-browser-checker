# Browser checker for Learn

Latest version can be checked here: https://stage-help.blackboard.com/Learn/Student/Original/Getting_Started/Browser_Support/Browser_Checker

This browser checker was created in order to allow our clients to validate if the browser they are currently using is a browser that we support.
I will explain in this document what most of the code does since there are plenty (according to me) of notes on the code itself.

The whole idea was to enable two things that the previous version lacked:

   1. Escalability on languages
   2. Escalability on the displayed messages
   3. Readability and maintenance

### Limitations

Several browsers such as Vivaldi, Ghost or Brave use the EXACT same navigator.userAgent and navigator.userAgentData 

   * Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.212 Safari/537.36" (Vivaldi on Windows)
   * "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.77 Safari/537.36"  (Chrome on macOs)

UserAgentData is exactly the same as well.

So, if the browser use the exact same userAgent as Google chrome, Safari, Firefox or Microsoft Edge we will not be able to identify them.

### Recomendations

We should not be identifiend supported navigators, that is not important, we should be identifying supported Browser engines, that way, we can identify this faster, easier and could increase the number of supported browsers.


### Supported versions

The object messages contains the possible messages, the attributes are always in english and the main keys are the first two letters of the ISO-639-1, if more languages need to be added, it is possible to re-use the exact same structure and update the message.key with the new language first two letters.

When started this project on May 2021, the valid browsers are (Includes mobile):

   * Safari on version 13+ on MacOS
   * Safari on version 12+ for iOS
   * Chrome 87+ for any OS
   * Firefox 78+ for any OS except iOS
   * Firefox for iOS, version 33+
   * Edge for any desktop 87+
   * Edge for android 46+
   * Edge for iOS 46+

### browserValidation

The object browserValidation contains the possible names that can be retrieved by the regular expressions, given there are several names that may change due to mobile browsers on android or iOS, each one of them has a key on the object and receives this attributes:

   * name: Is the general name of the browser
   * Version: is the BASE version of the browser that we support
   * nameAndVersionPosition: Is the name and the COMPLETE version position being returned by the regular expression (it HAS TO be an an array because of Chrome)
   * namePosition: is the position of the name of the browser returned by the regular expression
   * versionPosition: is the position of the version of the browser returned by the regular expression


For Safari:

   * Platform - Desktop - name: is the navigator.platform value that all macs return, since it is an array it can be updated with maybe the M1 value (if it changes)
   * Platform - Desktop - version: is the Safari base version on MacIntel
   * Platform - Mobile - name: is the name of the mobile platforms that can be returned
   * Platform - Mobile - version: is the base version for mobile platforms

### ReGex

I have available texts and userAgents used to get to this regular expressions
   * For Firefox: regexr.com/5sqlc
   * For Edge: regexr.com/5sqjp
   * For Safari: regexr.com/5sqjg
   * For Chrome: regexr.com/5sqja

Basically what follows is is just an evaluation that checks if the values within the array returned by the regular expression are contained within the array of validBrowserNames, if it is, it will assign a value to browser version, browser name and browser name and full version since it might be useful for support purposes.

I also set to undefined the vrowser name when there browserName is false.

### Messages

The basic structure of this object is:

en: {. // Indicates the language
    browserNameUnsupported: "Your browser is not supported", // Message when browser name is not supported
    browserSupported: "SUPPORTED", // Message when browser is supported
    browserUnsupported: "NOT SUPPORTED", // Message when browser is not supported
    browserPopUpsAllowed: "Pop-up blocker is disabled", // Message when popups are allowed
    browserPopUpsBlocked: "Pop-up blocker is blocking new windows", // Message when popups are blocked
    browserCookiesAllowed: "Enabled", // Message when browser cookies are allowed
    browserCookiesBlocked: "Disabled", // Message when browser cookies are blocked
    operatingSystem: "The operating system is ", // Message to indicate the OS name
    language: "The browser language is", // Message of the language of the browser
}

This object will allow updates for future languages, references and maintenance.

### Browser Object

Will describe each attribute:

   * validBrowsers: contains the object browserValidation
   * nameAndVersion: returns the full browser name and version (truthy) or false if it is not valid
   * platform: it calls navigator.platform
   * userAgent: calls again navigator.userAgent
   * language: extracts from language.navigator the first two letters of the result and compares them to a listOfSupportedLanguages that is generated based on the messages object, if the user's language does not exist on messages, it defaults to english
   * areCookiesAllowed: returns a boolean 
   * isNameValid: returns a boolean if the browser name has a value
   * version: returns browserVersion
   * arePopUpsAllowed returns boolean if it was possible to open a new window
   * isBrowserValid returns boolean if it was possible to compare the version and name to the object validBrowsers
   * whichOS returns the name of the operating system

### Functions to display information

We wanted to keep this update simple, deliver the same experience users are used to but updated in the background with more information, so we decided to use the same function names to avoid updating the html file.

   * get_withBb() Returns a message when the browser is valid or not (SUPPORTED, UNSUPPORTED)
   * get_os() Returns the name of the operating system.
   * get_browser_language() returns the two letters ISO-639-1 of the language code
   * get_browser(): returns the full browser name and version or (Your browser is not supported)
   * get_cookies(): returns a message that allow users to know if the cookies are allowed or not
   * get_popup(): returns a message that allow users to know if the pop ups are allowed or no
